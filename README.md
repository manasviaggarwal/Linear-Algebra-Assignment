# Linear-Algebra-Assignment
In this assignment, we implemented two parts:
1. In problem 1, we have to check if the system of equations have a solution or do nt have a solution. If the solution exists, then check if the solution is unique or not. Further, we have to find the feasible solution(s).

2. In problem 2, we have to check if the inverse of the input matrix. If exists, then find the inverse using three most common row operations: switch two rows,
multiply a row with a non-zero constant and add a row with another row multiplied by some constant.

All these implementations are done from scratch in python without the help of libraries.
